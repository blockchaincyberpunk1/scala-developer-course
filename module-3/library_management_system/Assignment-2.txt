Assignment: Building a Library Management System
Background:
As a beginner coder, one of the most valuable skills you can develop is the ability to create organized and functional systems. In this assignment, you will tackle the challenge of building a Library Management System using Scala, focusing on classes, objects, inheritance, and access modifiers.

Instructions:

Your task is to design and implement a Library Management System using Scala. Your system should include the following components:

Book Class (20 points):

Define a class named Book that represents a book with attributes such as title, author, and ISBN.
Implement constructors to initialize the book details.
Include methods to display book information.
User Class (20 points):

Create a class named User to represent library users with attributes like name, library ID, and borrowing history.
Implement methods to borrow and return books.
Keep track of borrowed books and their due dates.
LibraryItem Trait (15 points):

Define a trait named LibraryItem to represent items that can be borrowed from the library.
Include methods to check availability, borrow, and return items.
BookItem Class (15 points):

Create a class named BookItem that extends the LibraryItem trait.
Implement the methods to handle book-specific actions.
MagazineItem Class (15 points):

Create a class named MagazineItem that extends the LibraryItem trait.
Implement the methods to handle magazine-specific actions.
Library Class (15 points):

Implement a class named Library to manage books, users, and borrowed items.
Include methods to add books, add users, and handle borrowing and returning actions.
Main Object (10 points):

Create a main object to demonstrate the functionality of your Library Management System.
Create instances of books, users, and library items.
Simulate borrowing and returning actions.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness: Ensure that your code accurately implements the specified functionality.
Inheritance and Traits: Utilize inheritance principles and traits to structure your classes and traits.
Access Modifiers: Use appropriate access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control visibility.
Code Organization: Keep your code organized, modular, and easy to understand.
Documentation: Include comments to explain your code and its functionality.
Submission:

Compile your Scala code into a single file named LibraryManagementSystem.scala.
