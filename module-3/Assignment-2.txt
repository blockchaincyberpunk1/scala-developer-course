Traits and Mixins

Objective: To explore Scala's trait system and mixins.

Task:

In this assignment, students will dive into Scala's powerful trait system and mixins. They will create a program that defines traits representing various behaviors and then implement classes that mix in these traits to inherit their functionality.

Instructions:

Setting Up:

Ensure that students have access to a Scala development environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin or Visual Studio Code with Scala Metals.
Define Traits:

Instruct students to define at least two traits that represent distinct behaviors (e.g., Printable, Serializable).
Each trait should include abstract methods or fields related to the specific behavior it represents.
Encourage students to think about meaningful behaviors and methods for each trait.
Implement Classes:

Ask students to create classes that represent objects with different combinations of behaviors.
These classes should mix in the traits defined earlier to inherit the specified behaviors.
Each class should implement the abstract methods or fields from the traits.
Create Instances:

Instruct students to create instances of the classes they've defined, demonstrating the mixed-in behaviors.
Encourage them to showcase how the traits' methods and fields can be used within these instances.
Testing:

Provide sample test cases or scenarios where students can showcase the functionality of their classes with mixed-in traits.
Ensure that students thoroughly test their implementations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the traits and mixins.
Code Organization:

Encourage students to organize their code neatly, use meaningful trait and class names, and include comments to explain their implementations.
Compilation and Execution:

Provide instructions on how to compile and run the Scala program they have created.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct definition and implementation of traits representing distinct behaviors.
Successful creation of classes that mix in these traits and implement their abstract members.
Effective use of mixed-in traits within class instances to demonstrate the desired behaviors.
Thorough testing of class instances with mixed-in traits.
Organized and well-commented code.
Proper compilation and execution of the Scala program.
