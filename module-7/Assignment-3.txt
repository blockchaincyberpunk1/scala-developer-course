Web Application with Play Framework

Objective: To introduce students to web application development using Play Framework.

Task:

In this assignment, students will delve into web application development using the Play Framework, a popular web framework in the Scala ecosystem. The objective is for students to gain hands-on experience in building a simple web application from scratch.

Instructions:

Choose a Project Idea:

Ask students to choose a project idea for their web application. It could be a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing data, a task manager, a blog, or any other idea that interests them.
Setting Up the Project:

Guide students through the process of setting up a new Play Framework project.
Ensure that they understand the project structure and the role of essential directories and files.
Routes and Controllers:

Explain how to define routes in the routes file and create controllers to handle HTTP requests.
Students should create controllers for different actions required by their application (e.g., creating, reading, updating, and deleting data).
Views and Templates:

Teach students how to create views and templates for rendering HTML pages.
Encourage them to use Scala templates to generate dynamic content.
Database Integration:

If applicable to their project, explain how to integrate a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) using a Play Framework database driver like Slick or Anorm.
Students should create models and database tables to store and retrieve data.
User Interaction:

If relevant to their project, guide students in implementing user interaction features such as user registration, authentication, and authorization.
Show them how to handle user input securely.
Front-End Integration:

Explain how to integrate front-end assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) into their Play project.
Students should ensure that their web application has a user-friendly and responsive interface.
Testing:

Emphasize the importance of testing web applications. Encourage students to write unit tests for their controllers and models.
Discuss tools and libraries for testing in the Play Framework.
Documentation:

Require students to provide documentation for their web application. The documentation should include setup instructions and a brief explanation of how the application works.
Deployment (Optional):

Optionally, you can introduce students to deploying their Play Framework applications to platforms like Heroku or AWS.
Submission:

Ask students to submit their Play Framework web application, code, documentation, and any necessary database scripts through the course's chosen submission platform.
Evaluation:

Evaluation criteria for this assignment may include:

Correct implementation of routes, controllers, and views.
Proper database integration and data manipulation (if applicable).
Effective user interaction features (if included in the project).
User-friendly and responsive front-end design.
Quality and coverage of unit tests.
Completeness and clarity of documentation.
Bonus points for successfully deploying the application (if applicable).
