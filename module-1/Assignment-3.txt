Scala Control Structures - Conditional Statements

Objective: To introduce conditional statements and decision-making in programming using Scala.

Task:

In this assignment, students will create a Scala program that focuses on conditional statements. They will write a program that takes user input for their age and uses an "if-else" statement to determine if the user is eligible to vote. The program will print a message indicating whether or not the user can vote based on their age.

Instructions:

Setting Up:

Ensure that students have access to a Scala development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA with Scala plugin, Visual Studio Code with Scala Metals).
Program Logic:

Instruct students to create a new Scala project or Scala worksheet for this assignment.
Ask them to write a Scala program that does the following:
a. Takes user input for their age using the readLine function.
b. Converts the input to an integer using .toInt.
c. Uses an "if-else" statement to check if the user's age is greater than or equal to 18 (voting age).
d. If the age is greater than or equal to 18, the program should print a message indicating that the user is eligible to vote.
e. If the age is less than 18, the program should print a message indicating that the user is not eligible to vote.
Running the Program:

Instruct students to run the Scala program or worksheet.
Ask them to test the program by entering different ages to observe the output.
Documentation and Comments:

Encourage students to add comments to their code, explaining each step and the purpose of the "if-else" statement.
Submission:

Students can submit the Scala code they have written for this assignment.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of the program logic.
Proper handling of user input and conversion to an integer.
Accurate use of the "if-else" statement to determine voting eligibility.
Clear and informative comments explaining the code.
