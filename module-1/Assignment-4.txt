Scala Control Structures - Loops

Objective: To practice loop structures in programming using Scala.

Task:

In this assignment, students will work on loop structures in Scala. They will create two separate programs, each demonstrating the use of a loop:

Program 1: Printing the First Ten Even Numbers

Instruct students to write a Scala program that uses a loop (either "for" or "while") to print the first ten even numbers. The program should display these numbers in the console.
Program 2: Calculating the Sum of Integers

Ask students to write another Scala program that uses a loop to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive). The program should print the calculated sum to the console.
Instructions:

Setting Up:

Ensure that students have access to a Scala development environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin or Visual Studio Code with Scala Metals.
Program Logic (Printing the First Ten Even Numbers):

Instruct students to create a Scala program for printing the first ten even numbers.
They should use a "for" or "while" loop to iterate and print the even numbers.
The program should stop after printing ten even numbers.
Program Logic (Calculating the Sum of Integers):

Ask students to create another Scala program for calculating the sum of integers from 1 to 100.
They should use a "for" or "while" loop to iterate through the range of integers and calculate the sum.
The program should print the calculated sum to the console.
Running the Programs:

Instruct students to run both Scala programs separately to observe the output.
Documentation and Comments:

Encourage students to add comments to their code, explaining each program's logic and the loop structure they used.
Submission:

Students can submit both Scala programs they have written for this assignment.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of loop structures for printing even numbers and calculating the sum.
Proper display of output with the expected results.
Clear and informative comments explaining the code.
Correct use of loop control structures to achieve the desired outcomes.
