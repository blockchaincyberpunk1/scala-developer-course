Hello, World!

Objective: To introduce students to basic program structure and output in Scala.

Task:

In this assignment, students will write a simple Scala program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This assignment aims to familiarize them with the basic structure of a Scala program and the process of running Scala code.

Instructions:

Setting Up:

Ensure that students have Scala and a compatible development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA with Scala plugin, Visual Studio Code with Scala Metals) installed on their machines.
Writing the "Hello, World!" Program:

Instruct students to create a new Scala project or Scala worksheet.

Write a Scala program that consists of a single line of code to print "Hello, World!" to the console. Here's an example:

scala
Copy code
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, World!")
  }
}
Encourage students to add comments explaining the purpose of each part of the code. For example, they can comment on the object definition, the main method, and the println statement.

Running the Program:

Guide students on how to run the Scala program in their chosen development environment. They should be able to see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in the console.
Submitting the Assignment:

Instruct students to take a screenshot or copy the console output displaying "Hello, World!" as proof of a successful run.
They can submit the screenshot or output as part of their assignment submission.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful execution of the "Hello, World!" program.
Clarity and completeness of code comments explaining the purpose of code components.
Proper code formatting and structure.
Proper submission of evidence (screenshot or console output) demonstrating the program's execution.
