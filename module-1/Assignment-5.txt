Scala Functions and Modularization

Objective: To understand the concept of functions and code modularization in Scala.

Task:

In this assignment, students will work on creating a Scala program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a function. The primary objective is to demonstrate the use of functions for code modularization.

Instructions:

Setting Up:

Ensure that students have access to a Scala development environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin or Visual Studio Code with Scala Metals.
Program Logic:

Instruct students to write a Scala program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer.
Encourage them to define a separate function named "calculateFactorial" responsible for performing the factorial calculation.
The "calculateFactorial" function should take an integer parameter (the number for which to calculate the factorial) and return the factorial as an integer.
The main program should:
Prompt the user to input a positive integer.
Call the "calculateFactorial" function with the user's input as the argument.
Display the calculated factorial in the console.
Function Definition:

Ask students to define the "calculateFactorial" function with the following considerations:
It should have one parameter representing the number for which to calculate the factorial.
The function should use a loop (e.g., "for" or "while") to perform the factorial calculation.
Properly initialize variables and handle edge cases (e.g., factorial of 0).
Error Handling:

Encourage students to handle cases where the user enters invalid input, such as a negative number or non-integer values. They should provide informative error messages and prompt the user again for valid input.
Documentation and Comments:

Remind students to add comments to their code, explaining the purpose of the "calculateFactorial" function and the main program logic.
Running the Program:

Instruct students to run the Scala program and test it with various input values to ensure it calculates factorials correctly and handles errors gracefully.
Submission:

Students can submit their Scala program as a single source code file.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of the "calculateFactorial" function for calculating factorials.
Proper handling of user input errors and edge cases.
Accurate calculation and display of factorials.
Clear and informative comments explaining the code and function.
Correct use of function modularization to separate logic.
