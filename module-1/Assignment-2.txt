Scala Variable Declaration and Data Types

Objective: To practice declaring variables and using different data types in Scala.

Task:

In this assignment, students will create a Scala program that focuses on variable declaration and the use of various data types. By completing this task, they will gain practical experience with different data types available in Scala.

Instructions:

Setting Up:

Ensure that students have access to a Scala development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA with Scala plugin, Visual Studio Code with Scala Metals).
Variable Declaration and Initialization:

Instruct students to create a new Scala project or Scala worksheet for this assignment.

Assign the following tasks to them:
a. Declare and initialize variables of different data types (e.g., Int, Float, String, Boolean).
b. Assign values to these variables. For example:

scala
Copy code
val integerVar: Int = 42
val floatVar: Float = 3.14f
val stringVar: String = "Hello, Scala!"
val booleanVar: Boolean = true
Printing Variable Values and Types:

Guide students on how to use the println function to print the values and types of these variables to the console. For example:

scala
Copy code
println(s"integerVar: $integerVar (Type: ${integerVar.getClass.getSimpleName})")
println(s"floatVar: $floatVar (Type: ${floatVar.getClass.getSimpleName})")
println(s"stringVar: $stringVar (Type: ${stringVar.getClass.getSimpleName})")
println(s"booleanVar: $booleanVar (Type: ${booleanVar.getClass.getSimpleName})")
Running the Program:

Instruct students to run the Scala program or worksheet to see the printed output.
Submission:

Ask students to take a screenshot of the console output, which should display the variable values and their corresponding data types.
Students can submit the screenshot as evidence of completing the assignment.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful declaration, initialization, and assignment of variables.
Correct use of data types (e.g., Int, Float, String, Boolean).
Accurate printing of variable values and types to the console.
Proper submission of the console output screenshot.
