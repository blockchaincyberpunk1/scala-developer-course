Exploring Pattern Matching with Guards in Scala
Assignment Overview
Welcome to the world of pattern matching with guards in Scala! In this assignment, we'll dive into the power of guards, which allow us to apply conditional expressions to pattern matching cases. Guards add flexibility and precision to our code by enabling us to match cases based on specific conditions. Let's explore how to leverage guards in pattern matching to solve various scenarios.

Step 1: Understanding Guards in Pattern Matching
Guards in pattern matching are like watchful sentinels that stand at the gates of our cases. They allow us to specify conditions that must be satisfied for a particular case to match. This adds an extra layer of control over our matches, making our code more adaptable and expressive.

Step 2: Scenarios Requiring Guards
Let's dive into scenarios where guards shine:

Scenario 1: Temperature Interpretation
Imagine you're building a weather app. Depending on the temperature, you want to provide different interpretations.

Scenario 2: User Role Authorization
In a security system, user roles determine their level of access. Using guards, we can make sure only authorized users gain entry.

Scenario 3: Credit Card Validation
When processing credit card payments, you need to determine the card's validity based on the provided information.

Step 3: Applying Guards in Pattern Matching
Temperature Interpretation
scala
Copy code
def interpretTemperature(temperature: Int): String = temperature match {
  case t if t > 30 => "Hot"
  case t if t > 15 => "Moderate"
  case _ => "Cold"
}
User Role Authorization
scala
Copy code
case class User(name: String, role: String)

def authorize(user: User): String = user match {
  case User(_, "admin") => "Access granted: Admin privileges"
  case User(_, "user") => "Access granted: User privileges"
  case _ => "Access denied: Unauthorized"
}
Credit Card Validation
scala
Copy code
case class CreditCard(number: String, expiry: String)

def validateCard(card: CreditCard): String = card match {
  case CreditCard(num, _) if num.matches("\\d{16}") => "Valid card"
  case _ => "Invalid card"
}
Step 4: Implications and Use Cases
Guards bring finesse to our pattern matching. They enable us to handle intricate situations where simple cases won't suffice. Using guards, we can seamlessly incorporate conditions into our matching logic without resorting to complex nested cases.

Additional Insights
Pattern matching with guards transforms us into matchmakers with discerning taste. We can confidently create cases that cater to specific conditions, elegantly handling diverse scenarios. With guards, our pattern matching becomes an orchestra where each note is carefully orchestrated to harmonize with the melody of our code.
