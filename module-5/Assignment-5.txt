Monads and Functional Abstractions

Objective: To introduce students to monads and other functional abstractions.

Task:

In this assignment, students will explore advanced functional programming concepts, including monads, applicative functors, or monoids. They will implement a custom monad or another functional abstraction and demonstrate how these abstractions simplify complex operations.

Instructions:

Choose a Functional Abstraction:

Explain to students the concepts of monads, applicative functors, and monoids in functional programming.
Allow students to choose one of these functional abstractions as the focus of their assignment.
Encourage students to research and gain a deep understanding of the chosen abstraction.
Implement the Abstraction:

Assign students the task of implementing a custom monad (or the chosen abstraction) in Scala.
The custom abstraction should encapsulate a specific behavior or operation, making it easier to work with in various scenarios.
Ensure that the implementation adheres to the principles and laws associated with the chosen abstraction.
Demonstrate Use Cases:

Students should create a program that showcases practical use cases for their custom monad or functional abstraction.
Provide sample code or scenarios where their abstraction simplifies complex operations, demonstrating its utility.
Test Cases:

Require students to write comprehensive test cases to validate the correctness and behavior of their custom abstraction.
Test different scenarios and edge cases to ensure that the abstraction behaves as expected.
Documentation:

Ask students to provide documentation that explains the purpose and usage of their custom monad or functional abstraction.
Include examples and use cases to illustrate how to work with the abstraction effectively.
Presentation (Optional):

Optionally, students can present their solutions to the class, explaining their design choices and demonstrating how the abstraction simplifies complex operations.
Submission:

Set a deadline for students to submit their Scala code, test cases, and documentation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students' submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct and efficient implementation of the custom monad or functional abstraction.
Comprehensive and effective test coverage to ensure the correctness and behavior of the abstraction.
Clarity and completeness of documentation, including explanations of the abstraction's purpose and usage.
Creative and innovative use of the abstraction to simplify complex operations.
Code organization and readability.
