Type Classes Implementation

Objective: To practice implementing type classes for abstraction and reusability.

Task:

In this assignment, students will explore the concept of type classes in Scala and apply it to create a type class hierarchy. They will implement instances for various data types, demonstrating the power of abstraction and reusability in Scala's type system.

Instructions:

Define a Type Class Hierarchy:

Explain the concept of type classes to students and provide a basic understanding of how they work in Scala.
Assign students the task of defining a type class hierarchy with a specific focus (e.g., serialization, comparison, formatting).
Encourage creativity in selecting the type class hierarchy's purpose, or provide a list of options for them to choose from.
Implement Type Class Instances:

Once students have defined the type class hierarchy, ask them to implement instances for different data types.
These instances should demonstrate how the type class can be used with various types in a flexible and reusable manner.
For example, if the type class is about serialization, students should implement instances for common data structures like lists, case classes, and custom data types.
Usage Examples:

Students should create a program that showcases the use of their type class hierarchy and its instances.
Provide sample code or scenarios where their type classes and instances can be applied effectively.
Emphasize how abstraction and reusability are achieved through type classes.
Test Cases:

Require students to write test cases to validate the correctness of their type class instances.
Test different data types and scenarios to ensure that the type classes work as expected.
Documentation:

Ask students to provide documentation that explains the purpose of their type class hierarchy and instances.
Include examples and use cases to illustrate how to use the type classes in practice.
Presentation (Optional):

Optionally, students can present their solutions to the class, explaining their design choices and demonstrating the use of type classes.
Submission:

Set a deadline for students to submit their Scala code, test cases, and documentation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students' submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct and efficient implementation of the type class hierarchy and instances.
Comprehensive and effective test coverage to ensure the correctness of type class instances.
Clarity and completeness of documentation, including explanations of how to use the type classes and their instances.
Code organization and readability.
Creative and innovative use of type classes to achieve abstraction and reusability.
