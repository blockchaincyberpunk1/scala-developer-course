Exploring Pure Functions: Examples and Benefits
Programming is all about solving problems, and one powerful tool in a programmer's toolbox is the concept of pure functions. In this assignment, we will dive deep into pure functions, understand their characteristics, and explore how they bring predictability and reliability to our code. We'll also walk through practical scenarios that require pure functions and discuss the benefits they offer.

Understanding Pure Functions
Before we begin, let's define what pure functions are. A pure function is a function that, given the same input, always produces the same output and has no observable side effects. This means that a pure function doesn't rely on external state or modify any state outside its scope. Instead, it operates solely on its input parameters.

Pure functions have some fundamental characteristics:

Deterministic: Pure functions produce the same output for the same input every time, making them predictable and easy to reason about.

Referential Transparency: You can replace a function call with its result without affecting the program's behavior. This property enables equational reasoning and simplifies code comprehension.

No Side Effects: Pure functions don't modify external state, mutate data, or perform any actions that could affect the system outside their scope.

Scenario Presentation
Let's explore a couple of scenarios where pure functions come into play.

Scenario 1: Currency Conversion
Imagine you're building a currency conversion application. You need a function that converts an amount from one currency to another based on a given exchange rate.

def convertCurrency(amount: Double, exchangeRate: Double): Double = {
    amount * exchangeRate
}


This convertCurrency function takes an amount and an exchangeRate as inputs and returns the converted amount. It's a pure function because its output depends only on its inputs, and it doesn't have any side effects.

Scenario 2: Temperature Conversion
Suppose you're working on a weather app that needs to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

def celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius: Double): Double = {
    (celsius * 9/5) + 32
}

def fahrenheitToCelsius(fahrenheit: Double): Double = {
    (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
}


In these functions, celsiusToFahrenheit converts Celsius to Fahrenheit, and fahrenheitToCelsius converts Fahrenheit to Celsius. Both functions are pureâ€”they rely only on their inputs and don't modify external state.

Benefits of Pure Functions
The benefits of pure functions are numerous and significant:

Predictability: Since pure functions always produce the same output for the same input, their behavior is entirely predictable. This predictability makes debugging and testing easier.

Testability: Pure functions are easy to test because you can isolate them from the rest of the code and provide known inputs to verify their outputs.

Reusability: Pure functions can be reused across different parts of your codebase without worrying about unintended side effects.

Parallelism: Pure functions can be safely executed in parallel since they don't rely on shared mutable state.

Code Refactoring: The principles of referential transparency enable you to refactor your code more confidently without unexpected changes in behavior.

Real-World Scenarios
In the real world, pure functions are valuable in various contexts:

Financial Applications: Calculations involving currency conversions, interest rates, and taxes benefit from the predictability and accuracy of pure functions.

Scientific Computing: Functions that perform mathematical operations, like unit conversions, statistical calculations, and simulations, can be reliably implemented as pure functions.
