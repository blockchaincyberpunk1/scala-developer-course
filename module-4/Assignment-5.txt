Functional Programming Principles

Objective: To apply functional programming principles in a real-world scenario.

Task:

In this assignment, students will have the opportunity to apply functional programming principles to solve a complex problem. They will choose a challenging task that requires them to leverage key functional programming concepts such as immutability, higher-order functions, recursion, and pattern matching. This assignment encourages students to think functionally and design elegant, functional solutions.

Instructions:

Concept Review:

Begin by reviewing essential functional programming principles and concepts with the students, emphasizing immutability, higher-order functions, recursion, and pattern matching.
Problem Selection:

Instruct students to choose one of the following complex problems or propose their own:
a. Implement a functional parser for a simple programming language (e.g., arithmetic expressions or a subset of a real programming language).
b. Create a program that generates Fibonacci numbers using a functional approach.
c. Solve a complex mathematical or algorithmic problem using functional programming techniques.
Functional Design:

Encourage students to design their solution with functional principles in mind:
a. Use immutable data structures to represent data.
b. Leverage higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to manipulate data.
c. Implement recursion for tasks that naturally lend themselves to recursive solutions.
d. Utilize pattern matching to handle different cases and improve code readability.
Implementation:

Students should implement their chosen solution using Scala. They must follow the functional programming principles discussed and apply them to their code.
Encourage modular and well-structured code.
Testing:

Instruct students to create comprehensive test cases to verify the correctness and efficiency of their functional solution.
Emphasize the importance of testing for functional programs.
Documentation:

Require students to provide clear documentation explaining their chosen problem, the functional principles applied in their solution, and how their code works.
Include examples and explanations in the documentation.
Presentation:

Optionally, students can present their solutions to the class, explaining their design choices and demonstrating how functional programming improved their code.
Submission:

Set a deadline for students to submit their functional solutions along with documentation and test cases.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct and efficient implementation of the chosen problem.
Effective application of functional programming principles, including immutability, higher-order functions, recursion, and pattern matching.
Quality of code, including organization and modularity.
Comprehensive test coverage and verification of solution correctness.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
