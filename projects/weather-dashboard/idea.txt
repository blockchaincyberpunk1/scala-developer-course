Weather Dashboard:
Develop a weather dashboard that provides users with weather forecasts for different locations. The backend can be implemented using Scala with Play Framework, and the frontend can be built with React.

Backend (Scala + Play Framework):

Use external APIs like OpenWeatherMap to fetch weather data.
Create API endpoints to retrieve weather information for specific locations.
Frontend (React):

Design a user interface where users can search for and select locations to view weather forecasts.
Display weather information such as temperature, humidity, and conditions using React components.


I'll guide you through building a Weather Dashboard using Scala with Play Framework for the backend and React for the frontend. Let's break down each step:

Backend (Scala + Play Framework):
Step 1: Set Up Play Framework Project
Create Project: Use the Play CLI to create a new Play Framework project.
Step 2: Define API Endpoints
Add Routes: Define routes in the routes file for the API endpoints you'll create, e.g., /weather/{location}.

Create Controllers: Create controllers to handle the API requests. Use the WS library to make requests to external APIs like OpenWeatherMap.

Parse API Response: Parse the response from OpenWeatherMap and extract relevant weather data.

Frontend (React):
Step 3: Set Up React Project
Create Project: Set up a new React project using create-react-app or your preferred method.
Step 4: Design User Interface
Create Components: Design React components for the search bar, location selection, weather display, etc.

Search Bar: Create an input field where users can enter locations.

Location Selection: Implement a way for users to select a location from search results.

Weather Display: Design a component to display weather information such as temperature, humidity, and conditions.

Step 5: Fetch Data from Backend
Fetch Data: Use fetch or a library like Axios to make requests to the Play Framework backend's API endpoints.

Display Data: Display the fetched weather data in the frontend components.

Sample Scala Code (Partial Code Snippets for Backend):
scala
Copy code
// app/controllers/WeatherController.scala
class WeatherController @Inject()(cc: ControllerComponents, ws: WSClient) extends AbstractController(cc) {
  def getWeather(location: String): Action[AnyContent] = Action.async { implicit request =>
    val apiKey = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
    val weatherUrl = s"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=$location&appid=$apiKey"

    ws.url(weatherUrl).get().map { response =>
      val weatherData = response.json
      // Parse weatherData to extract relevant information
      Ok(weatherData)
    }
  }
}
Sample React Code (Partial Code Snippets for Frontend):
jsx
Copy code
// src/components/SearchBar.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function SearchBar({ onSearch }) {
  const [location, setLocation] = useState('');

  const handleSearch = () => {
    onSearch(location);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={location} onChange={(e) => setLocation(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={handleSearch}>Search</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default SearchBar;
This is a simplified example of building a Weather Dashboard using Scala with Play Framework for the backend and React for the frontend. You'll need to enhance error handling, user interactions, and styling according to your project requirements.

Remember to replace "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY" with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

This project involves both backend and frontend development, so it's recommended to have knowledge of both Scala (Play Framework) and React to complete it successfully.
