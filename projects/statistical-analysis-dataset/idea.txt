Statistical Analysis of Dataset:
Perform basic statistical analysis on a dataset using Breeze to calculate metrics like mean, median, variance, and correlation. This project will give you hands-on experience with data analysis using Scala.

Steps:

Load a dataset (e.g., a CSV file) into Scala.
Use Breeze to calculate descriptive statistics like mean, median, and variance for numerical variables.
Compute correlations between pairs of variables using Breeze's linear algebra functions.
Visualize the calculated statistics using simple charts or plots.


I'll guide you through the process of performing basic statistical analysis on a dataset using Breeze in Scala. This project will involve loading a dataset, calculating various descriptive statistics, computing correlations, and potentially visualizing the results. Let's break down each step:

Step 1: Load a Dataset
Load Dataset: Obtain a dataset, typically in CSV format, containing the data you want to analyze.

Read Data: Use a library like Apache Commons CSV or Scala CSV to read the CSV file and load it into your Scala application.

Step 2: Calculate Descriptive Statistics
Import Breeze: Import the necessary classes from Breeze for performing statistical analysis.

Data Preparation: Prepare your data into appropriate data structures (such as a matrix or arrays) for Breeze operations.

Calculate Mean: Use Breeze's mean function to calculate the mean of numerical variables.

Calculate Median: Compute the median using Breeze's median function.

Calculate Variance: Calculate variance using Breeze's variance function.

Step 3: Compute Correlations
Correlation Matrix: Create a correlation matrix for pairs of numerical variables.

Compute Correlations: Use Breeze's corrcoef function to compute the correlation coefficients between pairs of variables.

Step 4: Visualize Results
Import Visualization Library: Import a visualization library like JFreeChart or Scala's Swing library for creating simple charts or plots.

Create Charts: Based on your analysis, create charts to visualize the calculated statistics. For example, you can create bar charts for means, scatter plots for correlations, etc.

Sample Scala Code (Partial Code Snippets):
scala
Copy code
import java.io.File
import breeze.linalg._
import breeze.stats._

object StatisticalAnalysisBreeze {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    // Step 1: Load Dataset
    val data = loadDataset("path/to/your/dataset.csv")

    // Step 2: Calculate Descriptive Statistics
    val numericalData = data.map(row => row.map(_.toDouble)) // Assuming your data is a List of Lists
    val dataMatrix = DenseMatrix(numericalData: _*)

    val means = mean(dataMatrix(::, *)).t.toArray
    val medians = median(dataMatrix(::, *)).t.toArray
    val variances = variance(dataMatrix(::, *)).t.toArray

    // Step 3: Compute Correlations
    val correlationMatrix = corrcoef(dataMatrix)

    // Step 4: Visualize Results
    // You can use a visualization library like JFreeChart or Scala's Swing for this step
    // Create charts or plots to visualize means, medians, variances, and correlations
  }

  def loadDataset(filePath: String): List[List[String]] = {
    // Implement your CSV reading logic here and return a List of Lists
    // Each inner list represents a row in the dataset
  }
}
Please note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you might need to handle various data formats, data cleaning, and more advanced visualization techniques.

Make sure to add the required Breeze and visualization dependencies to your Scala project.

Remember to adjust the code according to the format and structure of your dataset and the specific metrics you want to calculate.
