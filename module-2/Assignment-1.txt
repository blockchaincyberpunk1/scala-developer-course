Hello, Scala!

Objective: To introduce students to Scala's syntax and basic program structure.

Task:

In this assignment, students will create a simple Scala program that prints "Hello, Scala!" to the console. The primary objective is to familiarize students with Scala's syntax and the basic structure of a Scala program.

Instructions:

Setting Up:

Ensure that students have access to a Scala development environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin or Visual Studio Code with Scala Metals.
Program Logic:

Instruct students to write a Scala program that prints the text "Hello, Scala!" to the console.
Code Explanation:

Encourage students to add comments to their code, explaining any new or unfamiliar syntax or concepts they have used in the program. This can include explanations of:
The "object" keyword and its role in Scala programs.
The "main" method and its significance.
The use of the "println" function for console output.
Any other Scala-specific syntax or concepts they encountered while writing the program.
Compilation and Execution:

Provide instructions on how to compile and run the Scala program they have created.
Testing:

Encourage students to test their program to ensure that it successfully prints "Hello, Scala!" to the console without errors.
Submission:

Students can submit their Scala source code as a single file.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of the Scala program to print "Hello, Scala!" to the console.
Inclusion of comments explaining the key syntax and concepts used in the program.
Successful compilation and execution of the program.
Proper testing to confirm that the program functions as expected.
