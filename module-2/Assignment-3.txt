Control Structures and Pattern Matching

Objective: To introduce control structures and pattern matching in Scala.

Task:

In this assignment, students will create a Scala program that utilizes "if-else" statements and pattern matching to determine whether a given number is even or odd. The primary objective is to introduce students to control structures and pattern matching in Scala.

Instructions:

Setting Up:

Ensure that students have access to a Scala development environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin or Visual Studio Code with Scala Metals.
Program Logic:

Instruct students to create a Scala program that performs the following tasks:
Accepts a single integer input from the user.
Uses an "if-else" statement to check if the input number is even or odd.
Utilizes pattern matching to achieve the same determination (without using "if-else").
Prints the result to the console, indicating whether the number is even or odd.
Code Organization:

Encourage students to organize their code neatly and include comments to explain the purpose of each section.
Input and Output:

Ask students to provide clear instructions to the user on how to input the number.
The program should print the result in a human-readable format (e.g., "The number is even." or "The number is odd.").
Compilation and Execution:

Provide instructions on how to compile and run the Scala program they have created.
Testing:

Encourage students to test their program with various input values to ensure it correctly determines whether a number is even or odd.
Submission:

Students can submit their Scala source code as a single file.
Evaluation Criteria:

Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of the program logic to determine even and odd numbers.
Proper use of "if-else" statements and pattern matching.
Organized and well-commented code.
Clear and user-friendly input and output.
Successful compilation and execution of the program.
Testing to confirm that the program correctly identifies even and odd numbers.
