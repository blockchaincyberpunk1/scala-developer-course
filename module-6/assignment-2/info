Exploring Promises and Completing Futures: Unlocking Synchronization in Asynchronous Realms
Assignment Overview
Welcome to an exhilarating journey into the heart of asynchronous programming with Promises and Futures in Scala. This assignment is designed to equip you with the prowess to harness Promises when completing Futures, ensuring seamless synchronization in the world of concurrent operations. As you delve into the scenarios, you'll uncover the magic of Promises that bridge the gap between asynchronous computations and external factors.

Scenario 1: Aggregating Results
Imagine a bustling metropolis of APIs, each housing valuable data. Your task is to aggregate results from multiple asynchronous API calls. How can Promises come to your rescue? Let's dive into a Scala program that demonstrates this:

scala
Copy code
import scala.concurrent.{Future, Promise}
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.util.{Success, Failure}

object Scenario1 {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val promise = Promise[List[String]]()
    val future = promise.future

    val api1 = Future {
      // Asynchronous API call 1
    }

    val api2 = Future {
      // Asynchronous API call 2
    }

    Future.sequence(List(api1, api2)).onComplete {
      case Success(results) => promise.success(results.flatten)
      case Failure(ex) => promise.failure(ex)
    }

    future.foreach(aggregatedResults => println(s"Aggregated results: $aggregatedResults"))
  }
}
Scenario 2: Event-Driven Computation
Picture an orchestra awaiting the conductor's signal to play a harmonious symphony. In the realm of asynchronous computation, external events play the role of conductors. Let's explore how Promises help us harmonize such scenarios:

scala
Copy code
object Scenario2 {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val promise = Promise[String]()
    val future = promise.future

    // Simulate an external event
    val externalEvent = Future {
      Thread.sleep(3000)
      "The event has occurred!"
    }

    externalEvent.onComplete {
      case Success(result) => promise.success(result)
      case Failure(ex) => promise.failure(ex)
    }

    future.foreach(result => println(s"Event-driven result: $result"))
  }
}
Scenario 3: Dependent Concurrent Tasks
Imagine a choreographed dance where each performer relies on the previous one to shine. The world of concurrent tasks often mirrors this harmony. Promises step in to orchestrate this synchronization:

scala
Copy code
object Scenario3 {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val promiseA = Promise[Int]()
    val promiseB = Promise[String]()

    val futureA = promiseA.future
    val futureB = promiseB.future

    val taskA = Future {
      // Asynchronous task A
    }

    taskA.onComplete {
      case Success(resultA) =>
        promiseA.success(resultA)
        val taskB = Future {
          // Asynchronous task B that relies on resultA
        }
        taskB.onComplete {
          case Success(resultB) => promiseB.success(resultB)
          case Failure(ex) => promiseB.failure(ex)
        }
      case Failure(ex) => promiseA.failure(ex)
    }

    futureB.foreach(finalResult => println(s"Final result: $finalResult"))
  }
}
Additional Instructions
Promise Power: Leverage the scala.concurrent.Promise class to create Promises and utilize the future method to correspondingly create Futures.

Experimentation: Embrace the spirit of experimentation by exploring various approaches to asynchronous dependencies using Promises and Futures.

Real-World Scenarios: While the scenarios are abstract, consider how these principles apply to real-world examples where synchronization and completion of concurrent tasks are vital.

Assessment Criteria
