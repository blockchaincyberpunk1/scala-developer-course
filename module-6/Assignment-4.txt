Introduction to Akka Actors

Objective: To introduce the Akka toolkit and actors model.

Task:

This optional assignment is designed for students who are interested in exploring Akka Actors, a powerful concurrency toolkit for building highly scalable and distributed systems in Scala. Students who choose to complete this assignment will gain hands-on experience with Akka Actors by creating a simple Actor system. They will design a scenario in which multiple actors exchange messages to demonstrate the benefits of using the actors model for concurrency.

Instructions:

Introduction to Akka and Actors:

Begin by providing an overview of Akka and the actors model.
Explain the core concepts, such as actors, messages, and the actor system.
Setup and Dependencies:

Instruct students to set up a Scala project with Akka as a dependency.
Ensure they have the necessary libraries and plugins installed.
Design a Scenario:

Encourage students to think of a scenario where actors can model a real-world problem or system.
Suggest scenarios such as a messaging application, a simulation of concurrent processes, or a simple game.
Define Actors:

Ask students to create actor classes for the chosen scenario.
Each actor should extend the akka.actor.Actor trait and define its behavior when receiving messages.
Message Passing:

Instruct students to implement message passing between actors.
Actors should exchange messages to coordinate their actions or share information.
Emphasize the use of the ! (tell) operator for sending messages.
Concurrent Execution:

Discuss the benefits of the actors model for concurrent execution.
Explain how actors can work independently and concurrently without shared mutable state.
Supervision:

Introduce the concept of actor supervision.
Show how actors can supervise other actors and handle failures.
Testing:

Encourage students to write test cases to validate the behavior of their actors.
Test scenarios should include successful message exchanges and error cases.
Documentation:

Ask students to document their actor system, including actor classes, message types, and the overall design.
Presentation (Optional):

Invite interested students to present their actor systems and discuss how the actors model benefits their chosen scenario.
Evaluation (Optional):

For students who choose to complete this optional assignment, evaluation criteria may include:

Correct implementation of Akka Actors to model the chosen scenario.
Effective use of message passing and concurrency within the actor system.
Proper error handling and supervision mechanisms (if applicable).
Quality of test cases to ensure correctness.
Documentation of the actor system's design and message types.
