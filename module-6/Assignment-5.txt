Advanced Concurrency Patterns with Scala Futures

Objective: To explore advanced concurrency patterns using Scala Futures.

Task:

In this assignment, students will delve into advanced concurrency patterns using Scala Futures and Promises. They will be challenged to implement complex concurrent patterns that are commonly encountered in real-world applications. By completing this assignment, students will gain a deep understanding of how to apply concurrent programming concepts effectively in Scala.

Instructions:

Introduction to Advanced Concurrency Patterns:

Begin by introducing the concept of advanced concurrency patterns, such as parallel map-reduce, worker pools, or rate limiting.
Explain the scenarios in which these patterns are useful and the challenges they address.
Choose a Concurrency Pattern:

Ask students to select one of the following concurrency patterns for implementation:
Parallel Map-Reduce: Implement a parallel map-reduce system that processes a large dataset concurrently.
Worker Pool: Create a worker pool system where multiple tasks are distributed among a pool of worker threads.
Rate Limiting: Develop a rate-limiting mechanism that controls the rate of execution of tasks.
Implement the Chosen Pattern:

Students should design and implement the chosen concurrency pattern using Scala Futures and Promises.
Encourage them to think about how the pattern can be applied to solve a practical problem or use case.
Asynchronous Programming:

Emphasize the use of asynchronous programming techniques, including composing and chaining Future operations.
Discuss how to handle exceptions and errors gracefully within the chosen pattern.
Testing:

Instruct students to write comprehensive tests to validate the correctness and performance of their concurrency pattern implementation.
Test scenarios should include typical and edge cases.
Performance Analysis:

Ask students to measure and compare the performance of their concurrency pattern with and without parallelism.
Discuss the performance improvements and trade-offs.
Documentation:

Require students to document their implementation, including design choices and any challenges they encountered.
Presentation:

Optionally, invite students to present their concurrency pattern implementations to the class, explaining the problem they solved and demonstrating their code.
Evaluation:

Evaluation criteria for this assignment may include:

Correct implementation of the chosen concurrency pattern.
Effective use of Scala Futures and Promises for asynchronous programming.
Quality and completeness of test cases.
Performance analysis and discussion of performance improvements.
Documentation of the implementation, including design rationale.
