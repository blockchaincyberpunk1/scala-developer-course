Utilizing Future Combinators in Real-World Scenarios: A Symphony of Concurrency
Assignment Overview
Welcome to the realm where the synergy of Future combinators transforms asynchronous operations into a symphony of efficiency and elegance. In this assignment, you'll journey through real-world scenarios, each highlighting the pivotal role of combinators in orchestrating concurrent tasks seamlessly. By mastering these examples, you'll wield the power to harmonize complex asynchronous operations with finesse.

Scenario 1: Parallel Data Fetching
In a bustling digital landscape, your application's hunger for data knows no bounds. Picture the need to fetch data from multiple external APIs in parallel. Behold how combinators unveil their magic:

scala
Copy code
import scala.concurrent.{Future, ExecutionContext}
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import scala.util.{Success, Failure}

object Scenario1 {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val api1 = Future {
      // Fetch data from API 1
    }

    val api2 = Future {
      // Fetch data from API 2
    }

    val aggregatedData: Future[List[Data]] = Future.sequence(List(api1, api2))

    aggregatedData.onComplete {
      case Success(results) => println(s"Aggregated data: $results")
      case Failure(ex) => println(s"Error fetching data: $ex")
    }
  }
}
Scenario 2: Aggregating Results with Dependencies
Imagine a dance where each performer's graceful moves depend on the previous dancer's step. In the realm of asynchronous computations, sequential execution is often paramount. Let's unveil the choreography of combinators:

scala
Copy code
object Scenario2 {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val computationA: Future[Int] = Future {
      // Asynchronous computation A
    }

    val computationB: Future[String] = computationA.flatMap { resultA =>
      Future {
        // Asynchronous computation B that depends on resultA
      }
    }

    computationB.onComplete {
      case Success(resultB) => println(s"Final result: $resultB")
      case Failure(ex) => println(s"Error during computation: $ex")
    }
  }
}
Scenario 3: Error Handling and Fallbacks
In the unpredictable terrain of software, handling errors is not a choice but a necessity. Imagine a realm where asynchronous operations intertwine, and graceful fallbacks become a lifeline. Witness how combinators paint a canvas of resilience:

scala
Copy code
object Scenario3 {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val computation: Future[Result] = Future {
      // Asynchronous computation
    }

    val fallbackComputation: Future[Result] = computation.recoverWith {
      case ex: SpecificException =>
        Future {
          // Fallback computation for specific exception
        }
    }

    fallbackComputation.onComplete {
      case Success(result) => println(s"Result: $result")
      case Failure(ex) => println(s"Error: $ex")
    }
  }
}
Additional Instructions
Combinator Arsenal: Delve into Scala's Future API and experiment with a variety of combinators such as map, flatMap, recover, fallbackTo, and more.

Real-World Representation: While the scenarios provided are abstract, reflect on how they mirror real-world situations where combining Futures using combinators is indispensable.
